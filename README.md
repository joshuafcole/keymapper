Keymapper
=========

Find all existing shortcuts in one convenient place.

## Usage

Use the command "Keymapper: Show Keymap" to open the keymapper window in a new tab.

## Context

Keymapper is context sensitive and will only show keymappings relevant to the
current window. This means, you should usually have the keymapper tab open in a separate
tabset from the window you wish to show keymappings for, otherwise you will only see the
mappings relevant to the keymapper window itself. This is a common misunderstanding and
